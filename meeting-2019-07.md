## Possible Topics

### OSGi Community Event 2019

The OSGi Community Event (together with Eclipscon) in October 2019 seems like the natural next face to face oportunity. Maybe we can propose a talk?
- probably too late to consider
- anyway: who is going?

### OSGi Membership

Becoming an OSGi Member (Contributing Associate or higher) is still on the table. But this will only affect a subset of people involved in GreenDev thanks to the 2-member limit for Contributing Associate membership.

### Reviving OPS4J?

- Pros & Cons
- Legal entity always has been an issue

### Do regular calls

-  say once or twice a month with a fixed time?

### Java Module System

> "It exists for people writing books about the Java Module System"
