## Topics

### What is the true value of OSGi, when is the break-even?

Gadi asked about experience when the overhead for OSGi breaks even in the real world.

Holger and Toni really agreed on the value mostly lies in "the learning path" is the real value. You are being forced to think early on because OSGi is really punishing you for sloppy api/modular design.

Can we add value here?

### Felix Connect

### Analogy: Elixir + Erlang

### Technology Spike: Febo

Toni demoed a tech spike that shows some very distinct concepts for OSGi development

1. Adhoc bundle creation from flat classpath input

2. Type-Safe Dependencies

3. Spring Boot like startup from Main Class

Toni will move codebase to Greendev.
Codebase is now at https://github.com/greendevio/febo.
