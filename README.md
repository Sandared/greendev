# The Green Dev Manifesto

__DISCLAIMER: THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS AND NOT A FINAL MANIFESTO__

## Problem Statement

We observe that Software is eating the world. 

There will always be more software created by more people. 

This means that there will be more diversity: people who write and consume software.

There will be more one-off experiments landing in production because the barrier to entry is getter lower.

Evidence: 
 
 * NPM (the node registry) is the largest, uncurated module repository in the world (heck universe as Ashley Williams buts it).
 * FaaS/Serverless movement favors the smallest possible units of development
 * The software delivery manifesto acknowledges that delivery pipelines are software pieces and need to be nurtured like that.

Therefor:
 
Complexity is growing inevitably. 

There is a concept that helps organizing complexity:

> There was this thing called modularity once. (https://twitter.com/mfeathers/status/1114925378752016384)

In the past, frameworks and tools that are known to help you with modularity - like OSGi in the Java space for decades - are getting the blame for being too comlicated, not worth the pain etc. (Shooting the messenger)

The value of *going the extra mile* is often questioned in fast paced product development. *GreenDev* expresses the long term benefit. It can help communicate the extra effort.

__Instead, we propose a value-driven approach to sustainable software development. We call this GreenDev.__ 

## Values

 * GreenDev favors Open Source Software Licensing (as in https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Initiative) over Closed Source Licencing
 
* GreenDev assumes that most software pieces will land in production and should be nurtured that way.

* GreenDev favors self service automation over manual processes and steps.

* GreenDev is about a sustainable practices in development (eg learning, sharing) 

* GreenDev advocates the re-use of parts (modularity).

## Why Green?

Green carries a lot of what we think is needed in the industry of software development lifecycle.

### Sustainability

### Mindful to the environment

### Recycling

> Software has no cost of disposal (https://twitter.com/schneider_chris/status/1115502152678617088).


## Learning Econonmy

Because there is no silver bullet, we need to embrace complexity and acknoledge experience (from failures) 

## Modularity 

Modularity is hard.

You need to have been burned at least once to appreciate it.

We know that there is no-silver bullet to modularity. 

But modularity is (as hard as it is) a safe pathway to tackle known issues with pervasive software everywhere:

 * Security (know your boundaries)
 * Stability (know the impact of changes)
 * Discovery (know the capabilities)

## Origin

> "I wonder why #modularity in #softwaredevelopment is so unpopular these days. Trends such as #serverless and #microservices treat advances concepts like #capability & #requirements as an afterthought. Is it too hard? Not important enough for people?" (https://twitter.com/tonit/status/1115134599586287616)

> "Letâ€˜s start a software sustainability manifesto. We need to start somewhere" (https://twitter.com/kai_at_ProSyst/status/1115328384253464576) 

## Relationship to Software Craftsmenship

We think GeenDev is a modern version of software craftsmenship. In a world of automation, persvasive cloud and self-service delivery a medival wording might be misleading.

We think GreenDev can complement Software Craftsmenship.
