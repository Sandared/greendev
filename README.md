# The Green Dev Manifesto

__DISCLAIMER: THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS AND NOT A FINAL MANIFESTO__

Software is eating the world. There will always be more software created by more people. 

This means that there will be more diversity (who writes and consumes software).

There will be more one-off experiments landing in production (test in production).

Evidence: 
 
 * NPM (the node registry) is the largest, uncurated module repository in the world (heck universe as Ashley Williams buts it).
 * FaaS/Serverless movement favors the smallest possible units of development
 * The software delivery manifesto acknowledges that delivery pipelines are software pieces and need to be nurtured like that.

Conclusion: Complexity is growing inevitably. 

There is a concept that helps organizing complexity:

> There was this thing called modularity once. (https://twitter.com/mfeathers/status/1114925378752016384)

Frameworks and Tools that are known to help you with modularity - like OSGi in the Java space for decades - are getting the blame for being too comlicated, not worth the pain etc. (Shooting the messenger?)

# We conclude

 * Throw-away development cost is always a loss. 

* GreenDev is about a sustainable practices in development (eg learning, sharing) & re-use of parts (modularity).

 * We dislike the idea that software development is a cost center.

## Why Green?

Green carries a lot of what we think is needed in the industry of software development lifecycle.

### Sustainability

### Mindful to the environment

### 

### Recycling

> Software has no cost of disposal (https://twitter.com/schneider_chris/status/1115502152678617088).


## Learning Econonmy

Because there is no silver bullet, we need to embrace complexity and acknoledge experience (from failures) 

## Modularity 

Modularity is hard.

You need to have been burned at least once to appreciate it.

We know that there is no-silver bullet to modularity.

## Origin

> "I wonder why #modularity in #softwaredevelopment is so unpopular these days. Trends such as #serverless and #microservices treat advances concepts like #capability & #requirements as an afterthought. Is it too hard? Not important enough for people?" (https://twitter.com/tonit/status/1115134599586287616)

> "Letâ€˜s start a software sustainability manifesto. We need to start somewhere" (https://twitter.com/kai_at_ProSyst/status/1115328384253464576) 

## Relationship to Software Craftsmenship

We think GeenDev is a modern version of software craftsmenship. In a world of automation, persvasive cloud and self-service delivery a medival approach might be misleading.

We think GreenDev can complement Software Craftsmenship.
