# Next Hangout Topics

Maybe as early as Wednesday, 24th of July 2019

> I think we need to discuss options around JHipster/Stackery for OSGi. I am discussing this with @Thomas Driessen and i am personally torn between „just a code generator, isn’t this just for tech demos?“ and „yes, that’s a way to give people the batteries to fly immediately and learn on the go“.

## Existing examples 

- JHipster
- Stackery
- Dropwizard

## Old examples
The "generate working projects" is not new at all. Lets mention some old examples (for good or bad):

- Ruby On Rails (I remember OSGI Enroute - at an early face - had ROR for OSGi as its goal)
